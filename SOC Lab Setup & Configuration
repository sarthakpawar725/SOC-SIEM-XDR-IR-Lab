# 🛠️ SOC Lab Setup & Configuration

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of how I built my complete SOC home lab using:

- Wazuh SIEM (Hosted on VPS)
- Kali Linux VM (Monitored Endpoint)
- macOS (Attacker Machine)
- Wazuh Agent (Installed on Kali)

This lab simulates a real Security Operations Center environment and provides hands-on experience in monitoring, detecting, and investigating security events.
